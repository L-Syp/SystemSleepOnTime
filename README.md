# SystemSleepOnTime
Program allows scheduling sleeping the computer.

It uses [my library](https://github.com/L-Sypniewski/RunCodeAtSpecificTime "RunCodeAtSpecificTime") for scheduling task execution which is based on a code provided [here](https://bhrnjica.net/2014/10/13/how-to-run-code-daily-at-specific-time-in-c-part-2/) by Bahrudin Hrnjica. The library can be used to schedule executing any C# code.
